Instacart Market Basket Analysis


My project comprises of data from Instacart Market Basket Analysis competition hosted on Kaggle. In 2017, Instacart announed its first public dataset release which is 
anonymized and contains a sample of over 3-million grocery ordrs from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, Instacart provides between 4 and 100 
of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. They also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of
time between orders.There is no data available about gender, age, explicit time or date.  The dataset contains a set of  relational files. 

The interactive app that I created can be used to understand the pattern of the purchasing behavior of the Instacart users and what they are going to buy next.
I'm using 10% of the data for my EDA project due to the computing restraints.
